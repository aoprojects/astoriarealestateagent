				<p>Insider's look into real estate and rentals in Manhattan and NYC - Advice to renters</p>

				<p>To be blunt, as a Virgo does a little too often, renting an apartment in New York City is much more of an ordeal than in pretty much everywhere else. NYC is the finance capital of the world; it heavily influences, fashion, theater, real estate, the law. Even with our virtual world, many highly paid jobs are located here, and with those highly paid, high stress jobs comes the need for good and efficient living (i.e. a great set of amenities). You come here to be excellent, and you expect it in return. Well, so does your landlord.</p>

				<p><u>Things you will need to set up before or while you move here:</u><br>
				- decent income, lots of money saved, or someone to pay for your lifestyle<br>
				- a real estate agent with experience, market expertise, and connections<br>
				- willingness to go through the -- excuse the hyperbole -- financial audit that everyone else has gone through who is on a lease in the city</p>

				<p><u>Why the long process:</u><br>
				 The vacancy rate for NYC rentals tends in general to be around 1%. Landlords can afford to be picky.<br>
				 Also, there are a lot of rent controlled and rent stabilized tenants here, and if you're going to get any part of that, landlords want to make sure you'll be good to them in the long run.</p>

				<p><u>Types of rental situations available to a new future resident:</u><br>
				Easiest rental to get because you avoid the rental application process altogether: a room share situation you heard about from a friend you know well enough to trust.<br>
				Second easiest rental to get: Luck out and hear about a sublet of a place that&rsquo;s available where and when you want, for how much you want, with enough space for your things.<br>
				Third easiest rental to get: your own proper place. Though you go through the rental application process with this one, this is still much easier than buying.<br>
				Fourth easiest: Find a mom and pop landlord that has exactly what you want and hasn&rsquo;t listed with a broker. (can be very hard to sift through all the agents advertising &ldquo;no fee&rdquo; just to upsell you when you get to their office.</p>

				<p>Now let's get nerdy...</p>

				<p>1. <u>Background info</u> &ndash; How buildings are managed: Pretty much every rental in Manhattan is managed by a property management company, and each management company manages each of their own buildings pretty similarly. It is the job of the agent to know which companies manage well, which are luxury, which are cheaper, which are sketchy but affordable, which are average and decent enough for some, and which are a steal.</p>

				<p>2. <u>Types of listings in NYC:</u> Open, Exclusive, and Limited.</p>

				<p>Open listings are allowed to be viewed and advertised by any licensed agent in the area, and often these advertisements look as if they were that agent&rsquo;s own exclusive. They're not. These are all over sites like Craigslist, Rent Hop, even Zillow. However, open listings encompass most of the market share and getting into one really depends on the skill and experience of your agent to know the area, know market pricing, have physical access, know the application process for that landlord, and in some situations be personally in with a landlord so they can get your application pushed through before all the other qualified applicants who also had everything together quickly enough to apply that day.</p>

				<p>Management companies like open listings because they&rsquo;re easy to publish to all agents in the city who know where to look. Truly, it would be daunting to an average renter to research enough of these listings to be able to find a suitable selection of available apartments, that renter would rarely be able to gain access to a unit on their own, and even if they did, they would very rarely be able to produce an application thorough enough to be accepted by a management company. You are competing against the open market and if you find a steal, so did everyone else.</p>

				<p>My advice: either be an ex-agent yourself who once worked the system HERE and who knows the process, or hire a current one who does.</p>

				<p>Exclusive listings are exclusively listed with one real estate brokerage. They are less frequent because a management agency has to work with only that real estate firm to get the place rented, and if that firm fails, the place doesn't get rented out and they lose money.</p>

				<p>However, the benefits to a landlord of giving one brokerage an exclusive listing include being able to more closely cater and observe the process. They can expect an applicant to be much more properly vetted against their criteria than they can expect with an open listing.</p>

				<p>Exclusive listings won&rsquo;t be directly available directly to anyone who is not an agent in the company given the exclusive, but other agents can always co-broke with that company to get the deal done if they find a client for it. It's just less direct. The listing agent always has to be present for showings, etc. In this rare situation, the best situation for a client is to work with an agent whose company has these types of exclusive listings.</p>

				<p>But please keep in mind that exclusive listings are the rarer kind and often it doesn't even really matter. There are enough open listings in the city that any agent of any company can get the deal done, as long as the agent themselves are smart and committed to the process.</p>

				<p>Other types include limited listings, which function like exclusive listings with several brokerages being given access. Similar deal, what really matters is the quality of the agent.</p> <br>

				<p> 3. <u>Finding the right broker</u> - honestly, the answer is to work by referral. The best and most successful agents keep working at it and get great reviews, and new agents good enough to become those successful agents will start by working under the agents you get referred to. True, sometimes you get referred to someone for reasons other than that they rock, but even so, referrals usually work out well.</p>

				<p>
				 If you don&rsquo;t think you will get a good referral by asking around, see who is the most helpful online. Search blogs, online reviews, etc. Don&rsquo;t find an agent off of Craigslist alone. Craigslist is hit or miss and mostly it's sleazy and full of &ldquo;expired&rdquo; listings that are just meant to get you into the office. Listing websites are often redundant and full of open listings, but if you feel the need to search listings, go to Streeteasy and see who has the most postings of the type of property you like. Streeteasy postings are often exclusive or limited listings and they therefore represent agents with at least some clout. </p>

				<p>Once you find your &ldquo;broker&rdquo; (slang term for either a licensed agent or a licensed broker agent):</p>

				<p>First: don't shop around and start &ldquo;dating&rdquo; ten real estate agents, trying to find the best deal. Don't be that two-timing client that nobody likes, that disappoints the other nine people and makes them want to leave the business because there's no loyalty. Don't make an agent for for you for free. Start what you finish. An agent has sworn loyalty to you. Give it back. Be a good human. Work with one, MAYBE two agents, and let them both know you're working with the other one.</p>

				<p>Second: you are going to have to get together a lot of paperwork. Be ready to feel like you&rsquo;re going through a financial audit, as mentioned above. This is a landlord's market and they want good tenants who will pay market rate for a good slew of amenities in a great city. Most of the approval process is financial paperwork. Bonus if/when you meet your landlord you seem like you&rsquo;re the attentive, caring, respectful, self sufficient renter that I know you are.</p>

				<p>4. <u>Standard broker fees:</u></p>

				<p>Pay your broker properly. We don't work for free. We shouldn't work for free. Stop trying to get quality services for free.</p>

				<p>There is no formal regulation on what &ldquo;proper&rdquo; means, but it is generally standard that in Manhattan, a the broker fee to the broker&rsquo;s company that got you the apartment (not to the broker themselves) is 15% of the annual rent. This means that an apartment totaling in $2400 per month leads to a broker fee of $2400 x 12 months x 0.15 = $4320, due a the initial lease signing, which you and anyone else you're going to live with can split however you like.</p>

				<p>In the outer boroughs, the broker fee typical ranges from 15% of the annual rent to just one month&rsquo;s rent. 15% is considered a premium out there, and most brokers charge just one month&rsquo;s rent as a fee unless they are co-broking a listing. If they are co-broking a listing, they get paid less because two firms now have to get paid instead of one. This is another reason why it's good to work with companies that have a lot of exclusive listings on Streeteasy, or an agent who is well connected.</p>

				<p>5. <u>Income requirements and application paperwork:</u></p>

				<p>The most common and ideal minimum income requirements of rental applicants, as requested by landlords is for all the residents of the apartment who will be on the lease to each make 40x the monthly rent per year.</p>

				<p>Example: if you make $4,000 per month, your annual salary is $48,000 and you can afford to pay rent of $48,000/40 = $1,200 per month. It is very hard to find a low rent like this in NYC, which is why most people at this salary range look for roommates. It's just practical. (Future examples, we&rsquo;ll say that in this situation you choose to live with one roommate in a 2 bedroom that costs $2400 per month.)</p>

				<p>Paperwork that may be requested of you in order to verify income (the more you can provide, the better you look):</p>

				<span class="indent2 italic">

					<p>a) Letter of employment on company letterhead, stating your salary, any and all bonuses and benefits, and any other expected income from the job. Include start date or how long you&rsquo;ve been with the company, if you have tenure or are a partner, etc. Show as much income as possible. If you have 2 jobs, get 2 letters.</p>

					<p>b) If you are self employed and don&rsquo;t have a reputable salary promised to you, you can show history of income by showing your past 2 years tax returns. (It comes in handy in this situation to not have written off too many of your business-related expenses in order to show a higher bottom line.)</p>

					<p>Note that you may be asked for this even if you have a good salary or if you are a successful freelancer who can show recent income via pay stubs.</p>

					<p>Here, your bottom-line income with be averaged out over the past two years. Let's say you make $48,000 last year and nothing the year before. Your averaged income shown on your tax returns is read as $24,000.</p>

					<p>c) If you are a freelancer and you are sustainably paying your bills with whatever your freelance medium is, you can bring in copies of all your paystubs for the last 2 months of work. This is almost always in addition to copies of your past 2 years' tax returns.</p>

					<p>d) Optional: Use a guarantor. Usually this guarantor is required to make 80x the annual rent per year, and they will have to complete ALL the same paperwork that you did, almost as if it were them applying for the apartment.</p>

					<p>So, in the 2 bedroom example above, you would be paying your share of the rent, $1200 per month, so your guarantor must make at least $1200 x 80 = $96,000 per year. Then your roommate must get qualified for the other $1200 as well.</p>

					<p>It is preferred but not always required that this guarantor be a tri-state guarantor. It makes it easier for the landlords to access them if need be.</p>

					<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a good tri-state guarantor, you can buy one. Insurent is an example of one of these companies.</p>

					<p>e) Show that you have money in the bank. The more you can show, the better. (Don&rsquo;t worry landlords or agents them raising the rent because you show a lot of money.)</p>

					<p>
					You show this this by submitting a PDF of the summary page of the last 2 bank statements of the account that has the most money in it and that has had the most in it for the past 3 months (after 3 months, whatever money is in a bank account is considered &ldquo;yours&rdquo; and you don&rsquo;t really have to explain where it came from for the purposes of a rental application). You can black out your bank statement account numbers for security if you like (I recommend you do).</p>

					<p>
					They may also provide in their application form a place where you can list your assets, so if you own real estate or a car or something substantial like that, it could help your case. Whether or not this is a section on the application depends on the landlord.</p>

					<p>f) Credit check - of course the higher the score the better. 800s is great. 750+ usually good. 700s usually good enough.</p>

					<p>g) Optional: If showing that you have money in the bank isn&rsquo;t enough, or if you have no credit due to having lived out of the country recently, they may ask you to prepay a few months of rent, or even to prepay a whole year&rsquo;s worth of rent in advance. This is common. Don't be insulted if this happens.</p>
